# Style guide

> **How to use this file:** This is the single source of truth for writing standards across all documentation pages. It is shared between the Writer and Reviewer skills. Before using this skill on a new project:
> 1. Fill in all `[bracketed placeholders]`.
> 2. Review the "Project-specific overrides" section at the bottom and complete it.
> 3. Where two options are offered, pick one and delete the other.
>
> If a rule needs to change mid-project, update it here and note the change date. Do not create separate override files.

## Introduction

The goal of this guide is to ensure all `[Project name]` documentation is clear, accurate, and helpful. The content transforms complex technical information into guides that empower `[describe the target audience, e.g. DevOps Engineers, Software Developers, IT/Automation teams]` to use the platform.

---

## Core principles

- **Clarity**: Use plain language and avoid jargon.
- **Accuracy**: All content must come from the provided source materials (transcripts, product documents, etc.). Do not invent features or make assumptions.
- **Consistency**: Use the same terms, formatting, and voice across all guides to build user trust.
- **Empowering tone**: Adopt a calm, approachable, and empowering guide voice.

---

## Voice and tone

- **Professional but casual**: The tone is professional but not stiff or overly formal. Avoid slang.
- **Clear**: Use plain language and short, direct sentences. Avoid complicated vocabulary. Aim for sentences of 20 words or fewer whenever possible.
- **Empowering**: Avoid demanding phrases.
  - Don't use: "You need to select a Workspace first."
  - Use: "To begin, select a Workspace." or "The next step is to select a Workspace."
- **Supportive**: Acknowledge when a topic is complex and provide clear solutions.
- **Human (for introductions)**: For introductory and concept pages, use a more friendly and human tone to connect with the user's needs.
- **Inclusive**: Use gender-neutral pronouns (`they`, `their`). Avoid idioms and culture-specific metaphors that may not translate well.

---

## Formatting and structure

### Headings

- Do not use bold for headings.
- Use sentence case (only capitalise the first word and proper nouns).
- Use imperative verbs where possible — they are scannable and action-oriented.
  - Correct: `## Create a webhook`
  - Incorrect: `## How to Create a Webhook`
  - Incorrect: `## **Create a webhook**`

### Page titles

- Use active, not passive, titles.
  - Don't use: "When a workflow gets stuck"
  - Use: "Handle stuck workflows"
- Keep titles to 60 characters or fewer.

### Introductions

- Start every page with a short, un-bolded introduction that summarises the page's purpose.
- Do not bold any words in introduction sections.
- Do not teach theory in introductions — save that for concept pages.

### User interface elements

- Use bold for user interface elements, buttons, and navigation paths only.
- Example: Click the **Save** button to keep your changes.
- Example: Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**.

### In-page navigation

For long articles with a main H2 heading followed by many H3 subheadings, add a bulleted list of the H3 titles under the H2. This acts as an in-page table of contents. Only include this when there are more than four H3 subheadings.

### Tables

- Use tables instead of bulleted lists for comparison-type content.
- Always include a header row followed by a separator row (`|---|`).

### Images and diagrams

- Format: SVG or PNG with transparent background.
- All images must have descriptive alt text of 120 characters or fewer. Describe the intent, not the appearance.
- Prefer Mermaid diagrams for flows and architecture — they are diff-able and maintainable in a repository.

### Quotation marks

- Use quotation marks only for exact values the user must type or enter word for word.
- Do not use quotation marks for UI labels or buttons — those are **bold**.
- Example: In the **Name** field, enter "revenue this month".
- Example: Set the condition to "status == complete".

---

## How-to step formatting

> **Project decision:** Choose one option below and delete the other before using this skill.

### Option A — Narrative steps (H3 headings)

Best for: complex processes where context and explanation matter as much as the action itself.

- Do not use numbered lists for procedures.
- Each major part of the process is a step, formatted as an H3 heading: `### Step 1: [Descriptive title]`
- Follow each step heading with paragraphs that explain the process in detail.
- You may use a bulleted list within a step for short, individual actions (e.g. clicking a button, entering a value).

### Option B — Numbered list steps

Best for: quick, action-focused procedures where the action is more important than the explanation.

- Use numbered lists for all procedures.
- Begin each step with a bold imperative verb: `1. **Create** your template`
- Add optional sub-steps, code snippets, or expected results indented below the step.
- Include at least one sentence of context before presenting a list of steps whenever possible.

---

## Code and samples

- Always include the language tag immediately after the opening code fence.
- Add a filename or title label when the file name is relevant to the user.
- Highlight specific lines when drawing attention to a change or key detail.

Example:

````md
```bash title="install.sh"
curl -sSfL https://cli.example.com | sh
```
````

---

## Links and callouts

- Use descriptive markdown links — avoid bare URLs in body text.
- Use callouts for extra tips, caveats, or links to related conceptual guides.

Available callout types:

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `note` | Additional context that is helpful but not critical |
| `tip` | Optional shortcuts or best practices |
| `info` | Neutral, supplementary information |
| `warning` | Actions that may cause data loss or unexpected results |
| `danger` | Irreversible actions or serious consequences |

> Check `ProjectConvention.md` for the exact callout syntax used by this project's platform.

---

## Grammar and punctuation

- Do not use em dashes (—). Use commas, parentheses, or colons to set off phrases instead.
- Use digits for numbers in technical contexts ("3 retries", "5 minutes").
- Use serial (Oxford) commas.
- Meticulous attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation is required at all times.

---

## Plain language

Replace complex words with simpler alternatives:

| Use | Instead of |
|---|---|
| use | utilize / leverage |
| get | obtain |
| before | prior to |
| because | due to the fact that |
| if | in the event that |
| help | facilitate |

---

## Words and phrases to avoid

Avoid the following in all documentation:

- `important`
- `very`
- `easily` / `easy`
- `quick` / `quickly`
- `simply` / `just` / `obviously`
- `with confidence`
- `things` (as in "handle things") — be specific instead
- `leverage` — use "use" or "using"

**AI-generated words to avoid:**
- `delve`
- `seamless` / `seamlessly`
- `robust`
- `building blocks`
- `unlock`
- `cutting-edge`
- `revolutionize`

---

## SEO and metadata

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `title` | 60 characters or fewer. Start with the task or concept. Avoid duplicating titles across the same section. |
| `description` | One concise sentence, 120–155 characters. Begin with an action verb: "Learn how to…" or "Reference for…". |
| `keywords` | 3–6 singular nouns or phrases. Lowercase. Reuse terms already present in the page headings. |
| `slug` | Lowercase, hyphenated, no special characters. |

---

## Missing information

If information is missing from the source material and clarification is needed, add a note explicitly in the draft.

Format: `[Note: Need clarification on [specific topic or parameter].]`

---

## "Related articles" section

When a guide needs a "Related articles" section, use this format exactly. The number of cards and column count may vary — adjust `cols` to match the number of cards (maximum 3 columns).

```mdx
## Related articles

Now that you know how to [complete the main task of this guide], you can explore these related guides.

<CardList cols={3}>

  <Card title="[Guide title]" icon="[icon-name]" link="/[path/to/guide]">
    [One sentence describing what the user will learn.]
  </Card>

  <Card title="[Guide title]" icon="[icon-name]" link="/[path/to/guide]">
    [One sentence describing what the user will learn.]
  </Card>

  <Card title="[Guide title]" icon="[icon-name]" link="/[path/to/guide]">
    [One sentence describing what the user will learn.]
  </Card>

</CardList>
```

> Check `ProjectConvention.md` for the available icon names for this project.

## Project-specific overrides

> Complete this section before using this skill. These rules take priority over the defaults above when there is a conflict.

### Protected terminology

List any terms that must always appear exactly as written — do not paraphrase, shorten, or substitute these.

| Term | Notes |
|---|---|
| `[exact term]` | `[e.g. Always use this exact phrase. Do not substitute.]` |

### Bolding exceptions

List any exceptions to the default bolding rules for this project.

- `[e.g. Do not bold words in introduction sections.]`
- `[e.g. Bold the product name on first mention per page.]`

### Tone adjustments

- `[e.g. This client prefers a more formal tone. Avoid contractions.]`
- `[e.g. Use "you can" instead of "you must" throughout.]`

### Words and phrases to avoid (project-specific)

- `[word or phrase]` — `[reason or alternative]`

### Heading convention

- `[e.g. This project uses title case for all H2 headings.]`
- `[e.g. Step headings must follow the format "Step N: Title".]`

### Additional rules

- In bulleted lists where a bolded term is followed by a description, separate the term and the description with a colon, never an em dash. Example: `- **SMS broadcasts:** one-to-many text messages...` (correct), not `- **SMS broadcasts** — one-to-many text messages...` (incorrect). This applies in addition to the global em dash ban. The rule is reinforced here because the dash-after-bold pattern is the most common place it slips back in.
- A heading at any level (H1, H2, H3, H4) must never be followed immediately by a bulleted list, numbered list, or table. There must always be at least one prose sentence between the heading and the list or table. The sentence can be brief and may end with a colon when it leads directly into the list (for example, `The five channels are:`). This applies even when the heading itself seems self-explanatory. The introductory sentence gives readers context for what they are about to scan and prevents the page from feeling like a stack of bare lists.
- Introductory sentences that lead into a table or list should be soft and reader-directional, not imperative. Avoid phrasings that command the reader, such as `Use this table to...`, `Use the list below to...`, or `Use this section to...`. Prefer phrasings that point the reader to the content, such as `Refer to the table below for...`, `The table below shows...`, or `See the list below for...`. The goal is to invite the reader into the content rather than instruct them on how to use it.
- The Related articles section at the bottom of every page follows a fixed pattern. Start with a single lead-in sentence that acknowledges what the reader has just learned and invites them forward. For how-to pages, use the formula `Now that you know how to [task just completed], check these related articles to make the most out of this feature.` For concept pages, adapt to `Now that you understand [concept just explained], check these related articles to [next logical action].` Then list each related article as a bulleted item formatted as `**Article Title:** Description sentence.` The description must be a full sentence written from the reader's perspective that explains what the article enables them to do or why it matters next. Do not list bare titles without descriptions. Do not write descriptions that simply restate the title. Aim for three to six related articles per page.
